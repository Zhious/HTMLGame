# HTMLGame
First HTML/CSS/JS website and game

Learned a lot, and most of all, learned JS isn't for me.
A combination of bad decisions and ignorance makes up this spaghetti code.
These are flat files
Took probably around 15-20hour to do this, of which maybe 3 hours on art.
It's very much unmanageable and expanding such a game would make it more of a mess. OOP is the way to go.
