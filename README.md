# HTMLGame
First HTML website and game, coded entirely by myself 

There are a lot of compromises I made. Such as the wonky feel of object creation in JS, makes my code not great.
Also the constant battle with CSS wears on you.
And yes, everything is a flat file basically, which I know isn't ideal.
