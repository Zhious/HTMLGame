# HTMLGame
First HTML/CSS/JS website and game

To play:
Download all files into a directory, open the index.html file in a web browser (Chrome).

Learned a lot.
My goal was to make the game not require more than 1 page (HTML) and while I did it, it's not feasible for managability.
Took probably around 15-20hour to do this, of which maybe 3-4 hours on art.
